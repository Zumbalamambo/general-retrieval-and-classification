# general-retrieval-and-classification
This is a Pytorch complementation of 'Combination of Multiple Global Descriptors for Image Retrieval'. You can use it for image retrieval or classification. 
The CGDnet is according to 'https://github.com/leftthomas/CGD'. I added some personal usually used tools.
Besides, I added codes in trainCGD.py for transferring learning. So it will be easy to adapt to your own work.
